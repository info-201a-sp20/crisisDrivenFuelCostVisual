What happens to prices of different goods when a major event happens? And how do prices recover? We are interested in this topic because we are all being affected by global events and we want to understand what it might look like in the future when a major event happens.

1. [Learning to love recession](http://www.brethertonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Learning-To-Love-Recession.pdf) covers the differences they found between companies that did well during a recession versus those who did not. They used a few data visualizations to explain their findings which were helpful to understand.
2. [Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2793127/) is a study conducted by Parul Christian. This study talks about the Economic crisis and Increase in food prices, then narrowing down to how they affect child mortality.

## Data Driven Questions
  1. How can our daily products prices be affected by global events/crisis?
      - Look at datasets and spot big changes in prices, find out if anything major was happening at the time.
      - We can then look at other products' prices at the same time and see how different products get affected.
  2. Do prices bounce back after such event? If so, how do prices bounce back?
      - After spotting major events that caused price fluctuations, try and look for price patterns after such event.
  3. What kind of crisis can we derive from changes of gloabl prices?
      - We can actually see if there was a crisis or an event where global prices changed and determine what it was.

## Datasets
1. [Natural gas prices](https://datahub.io/core/natural-gas#resource-daily)  
    - This data comes from U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA Data Dataset contains Monthly and Daily prices of Natural gas, starting from January 1997 to current year.
    - There are two sets of data, one is daily price of natural gas, the other is monthly price of natural gas.
    - Both datasets have 2 columns, daily price has 5876 rows, monthly price has 280 rows.
    - These two datasets could help us answer all three questions if we create some data visualizations and answer questions accordingly.

2. [Natural gas prices global](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/natural-gas-prices)  
    - This data comes from Global Energy Statistic contains Annually prices of Natural gas, starting from 2009 to 2018.
    - The dataset has 4 columns, 80 rows.
    - This dataset could help us answer third question by comparing prices by each countries and finding relationship between US and global gas prices.

3. [Global price of Brent Crude](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/POILBREUSDM)
    - This comes from International Monetary Fund, recording of US dollars per Barrel. Data ranges from 1990 to 2020.
    - The amount recorded is the average during that given month.
    - Dataset has 2 columns and 364 rows
    - This dataset on global price of brent crude can also answer all three questions since it records monthly price of gas prices per barrel. Which will help us see trends more clearly.
4. [Global Food Prices Database](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices)
    - Contains Global Food Prices data from the World Food Programme covering different foods for 76 countries and 1,500 markets.
    - They recorded prices based off of location and variety. Some data dates all the way back to 1992.
    - There are more than 1046915 rows (that my computer could load), and 17 columns, we will have to delete some unnecessary columns since it is such a large file.
    - This dataset is very helpful due to its thoroughness and range. We can use this dataset to answer all three questions as well. We can also choose to look at different regions and different foods during different times.
